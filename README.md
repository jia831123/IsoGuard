# IsoGuard

## Project Overview
[IsoGuard](https://jia831123.github.io/IsoGuard/)

This project is a disaster isolation early warning system platform based on React and Leaflet. The system aims to integrate historical disaster data, real-time rainfall information, and disaster prevention data to provide early warnings of potential disaster isolation effects for mountain settlements.

## Key Features

1. **Disaster Isolation Geographic Information Display**: Showcases historical isolation events, geomorphological and social information, and risk maps based on vulnerability and resilience indicators.

2. **Disaster Isolation Event Village Identification**: Utilizes the Common Alerting Protocol for road disasters to identify potential isolated villages in real-time.

3. **Real-time Disaster Isolation Warning**: Combines real-time rainfall information, Rainfall Triggering Index, and machine learning algorithms to provide real-time disaster isolation risk level classification for the entire Taiwan area.
